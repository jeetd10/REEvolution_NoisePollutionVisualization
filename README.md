## Objective of the Project
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize noise pollution data from various locations in Mumbai. By identifying patterns and trends in noise levels, we aim to provide insights that can help in understanding the impact of noise pollution on urban living and inform potential policy decisions for noise management.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Storage**: CSV files

## Data Source(s)
The noise mapping data was obtained from [Mumbai Municipal Corporation, open data portal, etc.]. The dataset includes noise levels measured at various locations in Mumbai over a specified period.
